A long while ago I stumbled on to something called speed reading. There were people out there who code literally read 800 to 1000 words per minute. Obviously this is something that peaked my interest greatly. I thought to myself, "if I can read faster, I can learn concepts and facts much faster". Which in turn meant, I could learn more things in a lifetime. This was further than the truth.

After experimenting with speed reading, I noticed that I was, indeed, able to read faster. As I read, I was able to also comprehend. However, as I went finished books, I noticed that I was not able to recall much after that. I decided to read in normal speed. With normal speed, my recall increased, but not exponentially. After careful consideration, I determined that the problem wasn't my reading spead or comprehension. The main culprit was reading itself.

By now you are probably thinking reading is good. Yes, reading is good. You can learn a lot by reading. The problem is that reading is a very passive activity. Inorder to learn, books should be read actively. You can learn more from a few pages of active reading than hundreds of books read passively. This is largely the fault of how the education system is designed. In school, we are thought many many new things everyday. There isn't really a time to reflect and think deeply about concepts. We are in a rush to study and memorize to pass tests.

Real learning comes from thinking deeply and building a strong base of fundamentals that can then be applied to other areas. When you take this approach, you no longer have to memorize. It is an approach that allows you to analyze the gaps in your thinking. You become a person who learns how to build knowledge rather than a person who knows how to store information. Many great thinkers such as Elon Musk, Richard Feynman, Naval Ravikant, and many more apply this to their everyday lives.

Let's take a simple concept such as canceling in fractions. Most of us know how to cancel a fraction. For example, to cancel down 12 / 24 we simple divide each number by the greatest common factor, 12. After dividing the numerator and denomenator, the fraction cancels down to 1 / 2. We can also cancel out by subtracting 12 / 24 by itself. Most people are comfortable with this simple logic. This gets us through the test. We just learn the rules to pass our test and move on. While you do retain knowledge from school, you never really get a deep understanding. Without deep understanding, you won't be able to learn how things are connected.

We can take a deeper look at fraction cancellation by defining a fraction. What exactly is a fraction? Most would say a fraction is representation of a piece of a whole. This is right in a way, but it is not an accurate definition. A mathematical definition of a fraction is the following:

"A fraction is an ordered pair with an equivalence class of ordered pairs where each pair can be obtained by another pair by cancellation."

This simple definition allows for a better grasp of working with fractions. For example, 1/2 is equal to 2/4 and 4/8 is equal to 2/4 and so on. Callcelation must abide by the arithmetic operators (+,-,/,*) in order to be correct. Based on the fraction definition, we can see that a fraction can be cancelled with any of these operators.

### Cancel out 2/4 
(2/4) - (1/2) - (1/2) = 0

### Cancel out -2/4
(2/4) + (-1/2) + (-1/2) = 0

### Cancel down 2/4
(2/4) / (2/4) = 1

### Cancel down 4/2
(4/2) * (2/4) = 1

We this base of understanding it is simple to cancel out fractions that have exponents are even square roots. With the knowledge the exponent operation is derived from multiplication and the square root operation is derived from division, we get the following:

8^4 / 

## Order Pairs
An ordered pair is a special case of a set. Notice that an ordered pair is not a set. A set is sequence of infinite numbers. A set cannot have duplicates. The elements of a set can be in any order. However, an orderd pair can have duplicates and it must be ordered. For an ordered pair, (1,2) != (2,1). The order matters. This is why a fraction is in part an ordered pair because the order matters. The numerator must be on top and the denominator must be on the bottom. However, in the case of the fraction, (3,6) == (1,2). In an ordered pair (3,6) != (1,2). An ordered pair is also a type of n-tuple know as 2-tuple. A tuple is an ordered list that can have duplicates. The order matters.

## Cartesian Product
A cartesian product is the result of set A x set B. All the cells in a table are a cartesian product of rows x columns. A caretisan prodcut is every match of an element of tuple A to tuple B. For example, if A = (1,2) and B = (3,4). A x B = (1,2) x (3,4) = (1,3), (1,4), (2, 3), (2,4).

## Symbols
:= This means defined. This is different than = which means a result equals something. Many times := is not needed. Context is usually efficient enough.

The curved E means in in the set. For example, a E A

## Tuples
Are seen in programming. A tuple in math is a set of related numbers. In programming a tuple is a set of related data types. For example tuple person could be (firstName, lastName, age). C# has tuples. Tuples are good for when you don't want to define a class or struct when you want to structure related data.
