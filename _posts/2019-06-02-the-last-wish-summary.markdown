Back in 2011, I picked a very interesting game called The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. I didn't know much about the witcher. I had no idea that the game was based off a series of books. However, I really enjoyed the game. The game had a really great and mature storyline. I also had a great world to explore and many great characters. The main character of the game is Geralt of Rivia. Geralt is the typical  badass anit-hero. He hunts monsters for a living and is really tough. That is the game. Fast forward to the end of 2018.

I begin to hear talks of a Witcher Netflix show. The  Witcher is a bigger hit than I thought. So, in anticipation for the upcoming show, I have decided to start a series of blogs that will summarize and review each book in the series. After the books I will do reviews on the games and the show.

The Last Wish: Introducing the Witcher is the first book in the series by Dutch author Andrzej Sapkowski. I revolves around the protagonist, Geralt of Rivia. Geralt is a Witcher. Witcher's are a group of people who hunt monsters in exchange for money. According to Geralt, Witcher's are taken from their parents at a young age and are trained to hunt monsters. They undergo intense training both physically and mentally. They have to eat certain herbs and concations  that will make them ill. At the end of the day, only the strong will survive. Geralt is the most legendary and strongest of all witchers. The ethics and code of Witchers is not made clear. However according to Geralt, his code is to only harm monsters who are truly a treat to man kind. He tries to stay out of human affairs as much as possible. Another thing that is very apparnet in The book is that witchers are either hated or respected. They are typically not liked by anyone. This facts are present in a collection of 7 short stories:

    1. The Voice of Reason
    2. The Witcher
    3. A Grain of Truth
    4. The Lesser Evil
    5. A Question of Price
    6. The Edge of the World
    7. The Last Wish

##The Voice of Reason

##A Grain of Truth
In this story Geralt enters somebody's property and sees a beast who rushes at him. He yells at Geralt and tells him to leave. Geralt doesn't leave. After Geralt and the beast exchanges words, Geralt is finally invited in. Once inside the house. The beast and Geralt laugh, eat, and drink. Eventually Geralt discovers that the beast used to be a man. A curse was placed on him that turned him into a beast. He tells Geralt that over the years he paid men for time with their daughters. Many of the girls grew fond of him, but none of the girls provided him with true love. None of them could break the curse. He says that one day he found a girl whom he felt real love. He tells Geralt that he found her out in the forest. He also says that she is strange and only comes at certain times in the day.

Geralt leaves the house, but not without having concern about what he heard. Geralt believes the girl the beast speaks of is a Rusalka. Rusalkas are described as having vampire like qualities. They live in the forest and suck blood. Geralt decides to look for the beast because he think he may be in danger.
